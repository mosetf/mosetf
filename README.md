Hey there, I’m Stan. I like building Django backends, designing clean database schemas, and using data to solve problems that exist outside tutorials. On tougher days, I consider switching to farming.

I specialize in Python, Django, and relational databases, with hands-on experience designing RESTful APIs, implementing JWT authentication with token rotation and blacklisting, and enforcing role-based access control. I’m also exploring machine learning and data engineering, and I’m currently building an AI-powered crop yield prediction system to apply these skills in practice.

**Core Expertise**
- **Backend**: Django, Django REST Framework, custom user models, middleware, API security
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, data modeling, query optimization, migrations
- **Practices**: Clean architecture, modular project structure, Git, RESTful design

**Currently Exploring**
- Machine learning workflows, from data preparation to model evaluation
- Building and deploying data pipelines
- Integrating predictive models into Django applications

**Open to collaboration on**
- Django API development and backend system design
- Data-intensive applications with well-structured databases
- Projects that combine analytics, automation, and real-world problem solving
